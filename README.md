# MQF634-Applied_Quant_Research_Methods

The idea behind this project is to basically improve the performance of a risk-parity portfolio through the construction of a risk index that encapsulates different risk indicators such as volatitility and capital market index. I personally worked on a sentiment index based on a dataset that was gathered by the federal reserve, and the index successfully identitfied "risk=on" and "risk-off" environments. However, given the constraint on the number indicators to be used, I had to drop my part. Nonetheless, I've included it here for those who might find it interesting. Unfortunately, the codes for the remainder of the project cannot be shared for other reasons.
